      <h1 class="welcome">Hello, there!</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Eliza Mitchell, and I am a software engineer.
        I got my start as a mathematician and writer, noodling around on the side
        with Python and Java. Then, I took the leap and took part in a fantastic bootcamp.
        It sounds corny, but it really did change my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        My projects so far have consisted of full-stack development and data science visualizations.
        For work, I currently do a lot with AWS, Python, and JavaScript. I also somehow got roped into building a server using Bash and other tools.
        However, in my free time, I am expanding into the wide world of embedded systems.
        Do you want to do an open-source project with me? Hint: I <heart> robots.
        Check out my resumé for contact info.
