      <h1 class="welcome">Greetings!</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Eliza Mitchell, and I am a software engineer.
        I got my start as a mathematician and writer, noodling around on the side
        with Python and Java. Then, I took part in a fantastic bootcamp to formerly launch my career in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        For work, I currently do a lot with TypeScript, both for Node and Angular (4+). This skillset is for a product that's aiming to be "the Wordpress of AI"—if you are curious, you can learn more about that product <a href="https://www.neurala.com/">here</a>. I also am volunteering to build out member services for a non-profit using Ruby-on-Rails.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I am expanding into deeper topics in Ruby as well as exploring more ways to present data. If you want to see a list of highlighted projects, check out the "Highlights" tab.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I am not coding, I am hiking tall things very fast... or climbing tall things very slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you want to do an open-source project with me? Check out my resumé for contact info.
